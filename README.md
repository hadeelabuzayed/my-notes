[Hadeel Abuzayed] 

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for innovation and digital fabrications. With one Year of experience in the field, I have developed a strong skill set in software development,**quality assurance**, and **project management**. I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools in order to continually improve my skills. 
As a **QA enthusiast**, I am committed to ensuring that software products meet the highest standards of quality. I enjoy finding creative solutions to complex problems and collaborating with cross-functional teams to achieve our goals. 

In addition to my work as a Software Engineer, I have a keen interest in **digital fabrications** and love to explore new ways of creating things. I am fascinated by the possibilities offered by:
 - 3D printing.
 - CNC machining.


 **Developers** face challenges like difficulty making changes, breaking functionality, and introducing new bugs while developing software. These issues arise due to the complexity of software development, time pressure, and poor code quality. Mitigation includes careful planning, communication, and prioritizing long-term project health.

 **Software design** aims to create easy-to-maintain systems that are helpful for users. To avoid complexity, developers should fully understand the tools and systems they use. Simplicity in code reduces bugs and makes it easier for others to understand. Complexity is the source of many software failures, and controlling it is essential. Projects can be extended unnecessarily if unnecessary features are added.
